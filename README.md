# FriendFinder 

## Overview
In this activity you will be building a compatibility-based "Friend Finder" application. (Basically a dating app)

* The application will take in results from users' surveys then compare their results against all other users who have completed it.

* The application will then display the name and picture of the user with the best match overall.

* You will use Express to handle routing and will deploy your application on Heroku so others can fill it out.

* For a demo of this application see: https://lasusan-friend-finder.herokuapp.com/home.html

## Submission Requirements
* Github repository and deployed Heroku link 

## Basic Requirements 
* Create a folder called FriendFinder. Inside the folder, organize your directories so it matches the following:

-app

-public
-home.html
-survey.html

-htmlsRoutes.js
-node_modules
-package.json
-server.js  

## Screenshots to see how FriendFinder App works
